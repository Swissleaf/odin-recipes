        <p>Chocolate Cake is a deliciously decadent dessert that has been a staple on our table for as long as I can remember!
             This easy recipe makes a rich and delicious cake that is perfectly tender and moist. </p>
        <p>Remember Gramma’s famous chocolate cake recipe that brought the whole family to the table after Sunday dinner? Or sold at a church bake sale? Or was enjoyed with a fresh, cold glass of lemonade on a hot summer’s day?  Hershey’s famous chocolate cake recipe is one I’ve enjoyed pretty much my entire life. Simple. Delicious. Perfect.</p>
